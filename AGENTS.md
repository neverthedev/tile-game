# Short Coding Rules

- Understand the goal before touching code.
- Documentation is in `/docs/`. Before changing code, read `docs/code_organization.md` and follow the guidance.
- Tasks live in `/docs/tasks/`. Update `docs/tasks/index.md` accordingly.
- Use comments sparingly and only when necessary.
- Use 2-space indentation for all code.
- Keep names clear; avoid abbreviations unless obvious.
- Handle edge cases explicitly.
- Preserve existing patterns unless they’re wrong.
- Avoid breaking public APIs.
- Keep error messages actionable.
- Don’t leave TODOs without context.
- Keep performance costs visible.
- Document non-obvious decisions.
- Use PlantUML in documentation when you need to illustrate architecture/solution.
